# Day 1: Lessons Learned

I've toyed with Julia on and off for a while, but this is the first time I'll be documenting what I learn as I go along, and almost all of it will be "new" because I've forgotten what I learned before!

So some of the things I learned on the day 1 challenges included:

1. How to read in text files.
1. How to parse text to numbers.
1. Recalling the dot (.) operator before function names to apply them to a vector.
1. Using the append function to add to an empty vector.
